Topic Analysis using NLP on Social Media Data
Overview

This project performs topic analysis and semantic exploration of social media data using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques.
The goal is to identify latent topics, thematic clusters, and discourse patterns from large-scale social media text.

The analysis uses a public dataset from Hugging Face (Exorde) and applies embedding-based representations and topic modeling to uncover meaningful structures in unstructured text.

Dataset

This project uses the following public dataset:

Exorde Social Media – December 2024 (Week 1)
https://huggingface.co/datasets/Exorde/exorde-social-media-december-2024-week1

Due to GitHub size constraints, the full dataset (~600MB), embeddings, and trained models are not stored in this repository.
